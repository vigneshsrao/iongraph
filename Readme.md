# iongraph

Script to parse the `ion.json` file generated by Spidermonkey's IonMonkey Jit compiler. 

This script just walk the json file and dumps the opcodes into a output file. I find it easy to read text and search opcodes in plain text.

# Usage 

* Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* clone this repo 
* `cargo build --release`
* `cargo run -- --help`


Refer @sstangl repo on the original [iongraph](https://github.com/sstangl/iongraph). That will parse the json file and create proper visualization and save it as image/pdf etc.
